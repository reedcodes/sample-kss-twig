# Sample KSS Twig

This is the Sample KSS Twig project! I built this to go along with presentations I've given on [style guides, pattern libraries, and integrating with WordPress](https://talks.reedcodes.com/).

This repository is available for you to use as a follow-along, or as a starter-kit in your own projects. It is automatically built using [kss-node](https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node), and (as of Sep 2021) using a slightly modified [Michelangelo Twig builder](https://github.com/szeidler/michelangelo-twig-builder).
