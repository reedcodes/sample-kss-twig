This living style guide is automatically built using [kss-node](https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node) from the pattern library's source stylesheets.

From [the documentation](http://kss-node.github.io/kss-node/), kss-node is:

>  "a documentation syntax for CSS" that's intended to have syntax readable by humans and machines. Hence, the kss-node software can be used to create a "living style guide".
>
> 1. Write human-readable documentation using "KSS syntax" comments. Can be added to CSS, Sass, LESS, or any other CSS Preprocessor files.
> 2. Have the kss tool automatically build a style guide from your stylesheets.

[The repository for this pattern Library and style guide is available on Github.](https://github.com/reedcodes/sample-kss-twig)
